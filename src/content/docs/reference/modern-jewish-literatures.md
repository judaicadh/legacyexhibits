## Introduction


The topics explored in this year’s seminar reflect the enormous diversity of Jewish literature in the modern age.  On the one hand, there are literatures in Jewish languages, principally Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino.  On the other, there are Jewish literatures in Russian, German, French, Arabic, English and many other vernacular languages. American Jewish literature, while belonging to the latter category, seems to delimit a sphere of its own reflecting, especially in recent decades, the “difference” of American Jewry.  We examined with great interest how in each of these cases the choice of the linguistic medium determines the intended audience and in turn affects the message about Jewish identity and culture.  In all instances, we saw literature as a site of intense struggle around the question of Jewishness and modernity in which all the resources of the linguistic imagination were called into play to negotiate the passage from traditional society to contemporary life.  What, then, is Jewish literature?  Is it one or many?  Are there viable criteria for determining what lies within and without the bounds of Jewish literature?  These questions, perhaps in the end unanswerable, do not cease to engage us.
