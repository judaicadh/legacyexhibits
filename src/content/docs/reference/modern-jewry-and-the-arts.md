## Introduction

This year's exhibition on Modern Jewry and the Arts presents work in a rich diversity of cultural media and genres. Jewish artists have been respected contributors to modern music, film, theater, and visual art, and their activities encompass high art, mass media, and popular culture forms. But what is "Jewish Art?" Any art produced by Jews? Any art with Jewish content? Is there a distinctive Jewish style?

Most of these questions presume standards set by conventional cultural histories, which despite universalizing goals, define the arts in national terms. Does that mean, then, that Jewish art is exclusively made in Israel, the modern Jewish state, or does it also describe art made by Jews in the Diaspora? Clearly, the questions that emerge from this study of Jewish art and culture are bound to the most pressing concerns of modern Jewish history generally, as well as to questions concerning the production and valuation of modern art.

For a study of Jewish art and culture, diversity acquires additional significance, beyond the variety of forms and media. These works express a diverse "Jewish-ness" -- belying the homogeneity that the term "modern Jewry" implies. They testify to the diversity among Jews, the many ways of being a modern Jew, and through the arts, suggest ways of constructing a modern Jewish identity. At the same time, while often preoccupied with the concerns of Jewish community, Jewish artists in the modern period have avoided parochialism and participated in the many national cultures of which they are also a part. This participation extends to culture's institutional forms: its markets and commerce, its museums and academies, media distributions and technology-all sites where Jews have played an active and formative role.

Our exhibit offers a few examples of works that address these issues and our discussions this year. Each Fellow has selected an image from a particular branch of the arts that represents the strength and the challenge of modern Jewish culture. They demonstrate the extraordinary depth and variety of Jewish art, and suggest, we hope, new avenues of cultural research.

### Art

#### **Maurycy Gottlieb, Self-Portrait, 1878**

Ezra Mendelsohn

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200125192627im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/mendelsohn.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="2588">

In this beautiful painting Maurycy Gottlieb presents himself to us in the formal attire favored by Central European intellectuals of his time. But he also seems to be accentuating his "Jewish features " - his rather thick lips, half-closed, melancholy eyes, and large nose. He therefore presents to the world his twin identity as "European, " even "Pole " ( "Maurycy, " or, as he was known in the German-speaking lands, "Moritz ") and as Jew ( "Moshe, " or "Moyshe "). The co-existence within Gottlieb's soul of these two identities provides a key to the understanding of the life and work of this pioneer "Jewish artist. "

**Ken Aptekar, _Her Father Dragged Her from Shtetl to Shtetl \[with a sewing machine\]_**

Ken Aptekar's paintings deal with ethnic and gender stereotypes. This image, _Her Father Dragged Her from Shtetl to Shtetl \[with a sewing machine.\]_(1996), uses Francois Boucher's Portrait of Mme. Pompadour (1756) as its source, and delivers witty and moving insight on the modern Jewish woman. The text portion, etched in glass that covers the painted surface, is long and detailed; reading it carefully demands that the viewer's attention crawl over every detail of painted ribbon, frill and furbelow. Mme Pompadour, and Rococo style of painting have long been considered the essence of \_frou-frou\_femininity in our culture, but it is a femininity of wealth and aristocracy, of leisure play and frill, of gentle curves and erotic theater. And while it seems so remote from _shtetl_ story of Mierle Pomerance (not Pompadour), schlepping her sewing machine from town to town as she "fashioned clothes for Jews, " the sense of fashion, fate and fantasy draws the two women close. "'A couturihre your grandma could've been,' my mother says, " in the syntax of translated Yiddish. The story ends with the artist's greater sense of possibility-- "I escaped when I became an artist " -but leaves the Jewish woman sewing for the far-off Jewish princess, whose cultural standard is set -still- by the Pompadour.

**Ben Shahn, Mural for the Jersey Homesteads, 1936-37 Roosevelt Public School, Roosevelt, New Jersey**

In 1936, Ben Shahn (1898-1969) was selected to create a mural for the Jersey Homesteads, a Jewish workers' utopian community in New Jersey. This was the first mural that Shahn completed under the New Deal, and he painted it in true fresco which he mastered as an apprentice to Diego Rivera. Inspired by Rivera, by Italian Renaissance frescoes, modernist montage and avant-garde film (Shahn was friends with film theorist Jay Leyda), Shahn created a multi-level fresco sub-divided into individual vignettes, and marked by quick thematic and temporal shifts. Divided into three main sections, the untitled fresco represents Jewish immigration to America, the oppressive tenements and sweatshops of New York, and the reforms demanded by labor unions and those provided by the New Deal. Rather than a path specific to Jews, Shahn proposes a direction for the whole working class to follow. Namely, to build cross-union and inter-cultural alliances, to move back to the land, and live by the example of the Jersey Homesteads.

### Music

### "ENTARTETE MUSIK" - Degenerate Music

Marion Kant

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200125192807im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/kant.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="2588">

After Hitler seized power in January 1933 the Nazis immediately installed racial laws and expelled political enemies and generally unwanted people from German society. They made a more or less normal life impossible for those, whom they labelled "degenerate", "unhealthy" or "sick". By the end of the 1930s the Nazis had begun to gas helpless inmates of insane asylums, the educationally sub-normal and the physically crippled. 75,000 German citizens died in the so-called "Action T4" and another 400, 000 were forcibly sterilized. The gassing of these innocent and harmless people stopped in 1941 because the Nazi regime needed the experienced gassing teams to set up the death camps at Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor and Maidanek.

Behind the aggressive Darwinian culling of what the Nazi called the hereditarily unfit lay a deep cultural pessimism. Three generations of prophets of doom like Spengler had foretold _den Untergang des Abendlandes_ or the _Decline of the West_. The preachers of disaster had taught them that Western and in particular German civilisation and culture were in decline and one of the agents of that decline was what the Germans called untranslatably _Das Judentum_ or Jewry. The Jews represented the faceless modern world, the loss of community, and urban development. They became the scapegoats for everything from slums to female emancipation, a deeply threatening aspect of modern life. This cultural anti-Semitism was a new variant of an old paranoia, but it was on a different scale. Judaism was no longer rejected as a religion, with all its awful implications. It was turned into a race. Cultural pessimism and social Darwinism reinforced each other. Jews were parasites, as Hitler was fond of explaining and in nature healthy organisms exterminated parasitic life forms. In the social world, healthy humanity, that is, the Aryan race, had to cull the parasitic Jewish one. The Jews had to be stripped of civil rights, isolated and removed from humanity. Hitler declared that he wanted the Jews eradicated and an entire nation worked towards that goal.

The ideological mechanisms produced one-dimensional explanations. Thus, for the Nazis, artists fell under the category of "Jewish" as soon as they did not submit to the prescribed cultural policies. Modernity was Jewish, consequently modern composers had to be Jewish. Jazz was Jewish, hence jazz musicians per se were Jewish. For some artists this was an honorary title: the writer Erich Maria Remarque, who wrote the famous _All Quiet on the Western Front_ asked for his novels to be included, when the books were burnt in Berlin in May 1933. He wished to be a member rather of "Jewish society, " not a German one, which had made such murderous distinctions. The exhibitions of "Entartete Kunst " staged in June 1937 and on "Entartete Musik " that followed in May 1938 were public displays of such thinking. The Nazis saw them as powerful ideological instruments and, therefore, intrinsically political, in service to the racial state.

The Nazis took art and music seriously: deadly seriously. They saw them as powerful ideological instruments and, therefore, intrinsically political, in service to the racial state. Because the Nazis politicised the arts, some artists and critics have reacted since 1945 by claiming that the arts must be apolitical. Is that an acceptable response to the barbarous misuse of artistic activity? This is an important question, which every artist has to answer in her or his own way. It is an illusion to imagine that we can escape the realities of a highly political world by ignoring the close relationship of politics and arts. The arts are not now above politics any more than they were in the 1930s.

### Paul Robeson's "Chassidic Chant of Levi Isaac of Berditschev"

Jonathan Karp

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200125192807im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/karp.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="2588">The _Chassidic Chant_, taken from Paul Robeson's 1958 performance at Carnegie Hall, powerfully expresses Robeson's belief in the unique cultural relationship between blacks and Jews. His rendition here adapts of the version of the _Kaddish_ prayer ascribed to the Hasidic master Levi Isaac of Berditschev (1740-1810), a piece also known as the _Din Toyre mit Got_. Robeson introduces it through a remarkable narrative chain that links the religious music of eastern Europe, the Orthodox church, eastern churches generally, the Coptic and Abyssinian churches, the African religious festival, the African chant, the African American church, and finally the remembered song of his own preacher father (suggesting a highly personal connection indeed). These specific ethnologic and religious associations, though broad, tenuous and vague, remain secondary, however, to a thematic one: that of common suffering and oppression, stubborn defiance of and determined resistance to a succession of oppressors (including the Germans and the English) expressed through faith, protest, and song.

Robeson's concert repertoire was always eclectic, reflecting not just his linguistic virtuosity but also the Left's ideological commitment to internationalism and "the songs of many lands " (he also performed _Chin Chin, the Chinese marching song_, an Eskimo ballad, a Gaelic folksong, the _Volga Boat Song_, and _Loch Lomand_, as well as numerous operatic pieces in different languages and a large number of spirituals). Nevertheless, as early as the 1920s, Robeson professed the belief that the cultural and musical affinities between blacks and Jews are qualitatively unique and transcendent ones.

### Zahava Ben sings Arabic, Israel, 1995

In early 1995, Zahava Ben released a CD on her own label, entitled _Zahava Ben sings Arabic_. The silver and gold cover portrays Ben inscribed within the profile of the renowned Egyptian singer, Umm Kulthum. Later, in the fall of 1995, in the aftermath of Prime Minister Rabin's assassination, Moroccan Israeli singer, Zahava Ben released a CD of Umm Kulthum repertoire on the Helicon label. As many Israelis and Palestinians embraced a shared experience of grief over Rabin's death and the unsettling peace prospects, Zahava Ben's CDs and appearances in Nablus and Jericho resonated with musical, political, and commercial overtones.

### Contemporary Jewish Music in America 1960s-1990s

The growth of Jewish music over the past few decades has been staggering. While it is impossible to provide an exact number of recordings, since no distributors or retail outlets service the entire Jewish community, members of the industry estimate that there are currently over 2,000 recordings of Jewish music available and close to 250 records released each year. There are over four hundred artists and groups performing Jewish music today and most listeners and consumers are aware of only a few. The creation of new Jewish music, which ranges greatly in terms of musical styles, is found throughout the Jewish community: religious communities, Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Renewal; Yiddishists, Yiddish songs and klezmer music; Israeli; and, art music composers and established popular artists. Jewish music has arrived and is a growing industry.

Shlomo Carlebach was an important transitory figure in the world of American Jewish Music. He was born in Germany, his father was a rabbi, and trained in a yeshiva. While serving as a rabbi in New Jersey in the 1950s he began to write music. His songs combine aspects of hassidic music and folk music. Like hassidic music Carlebach songs are in two or three parts with each part repeating. Carlebach songs are "folk" music in that the melodies are accessible and easy to sing. He sang songs in various Jewish and non-Jewish contexts seeking to engage young Jews into their tradition. Music was his vechicle. One of his earliest recordings Shlomo Carlebach at the Village Gate provides an example of his well-known songs based on a verse from psalms, "Eso Einai."

\* \* \* \* \* \* \*

An American born baby boomer generation sought to experience Judaism and adapt their American journey. Avraham Fried is a Lubavitcher Hasid living in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. His music is popular in the community. His songs are in Hebrew, Yiddish and English that are Hassidic in origin or original. One popular song is "Didoh Bei" which is based on a passage from the Talmud Nedarim 41a, "If you have knowledge", the song was written by Yossi Green. "Didoh Bei" is commonly heard at Orthodox weddings. The musical style combines pop music and Middle Eastern rhythms and styles.

\* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Debbie Friedman grew up feeling that liturgy in the synagogue was not accessible. She sought to make liturgy prayerful and participatory. She began writing music for youth services in the 1970s and as a song leader she created participatory services at summer camps. For two and half decades her music has become widely known throughout American Reform and Conservative synagogues. Some of her most popular liturgical melodies are "Oseh Shalom" and "Mi Shebeirach." Her English songs provide new insights to biblical passages such as "Miriam's Song" and "L'chi Lach." The song "L'chi Lach" is an interpretation of the biblical passage Lech Lecha, Abraham's call to go out.

\* \* \* \* \* \* \*

American born musicians who played traditional music started the Klezmer Revival of the 1970s, they sought to discover the music of their heritage. The 78 rpm recordings of the 1920s and 1930s served as models for repertoire and style, the recordings of legendary clarinetist Dave Tarras and Naftule Brandwein. At first the klezmer revivalists reproduced the earlier recordings then they sought to innovate and adapt. Three renditions of "Der Heyser Bulgar" \["The Hot Bulgar"\] trace this line of development: Brandwein's 1920s recording, the Klezmer Conservatory Band with Itzhak Perlman, and by the fusion klezmer band The Klezmatics, who instead of full band instrumentation only use percussion with more ornamentation. The birth of new music among secular Yiddishists is growing, one example is The Well, new Yiddish songs based on poetry with the songs written and sung by Chava Alberstein with the Klezmatics, "Zayt Gezunt" \["Farewell"\]).
