## Introduction

![](/assets/13th%20Century/13thCenturySplash.jpg)

The 2012-13 fellowship year at the Katz Center brought together scholars of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic social and intellectual history to develop a more fully integrated account of Europe and the Mediterranean basin in the 13th century. Diverse phenomena such as the creation of new philosophic and scientific cultures, the emergence of medieval halakhah (Jewish legal praxis), the diffusion of Kabbalah, the establishment of new mendicant orders, the institutionalization of Sufi brotherhoods, the rise of universities, and the role of inquisitors were studied, not only as isolated phenomena but in their mutual interrelations. In this on-line exhibition we highlight a number of original sources that were draw upon by these scholars in the course of their research: Hebrew, Latin and Arabic manuscripts and early printed texts which illustrate a range of topics such as medieval liturgical poetry, law, rhetoric, philosophy, science, magic, social history, gender relations, inter-communal contact, conflict and other forms of entanglement both positive and negative.

Exhibition cover design adapted from a decorative incipit and illuminated motifs found in a 13th-century Latin translation of an Arabic medical treatise by a 9th/10th-century Jewish physician (Isaac Israeli/Abu Ya'qub Ishaq ibn Suleiman al-Isra'ili)) to the Fatimid Caliph Ubaid Allah al-Mahdi (909-34) in Qairawan (found in present-day Tunisia). The original codex, a miscellany of the fundamental medical textbooks of thirteenth-century Paris, is found in the Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries, manuscript 24 (decorative elements on folio 51 verso, 52 recto and elsewhere). Design credit: Leslie Vallhonrat.
