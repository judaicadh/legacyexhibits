### Dr. Erna Meyer, _Wie kocht man in Erez Israel?_

How to cook in Palestine? This question was addressed in a plethora of publications in the Yishuv of the 1930s. One of the most active participants in this debate was Dr. Erna Meyer. Herself an immigrant from Nazi Germany, she had been a well-known expert on the domestic economy and the rationalization of housework prior to her immigration. Her cookbook _How to Cook in Palestine_ was published in 1936 in Tel Aviv on behalf of the WIZO. It appeared in German, Hebrew, and English. The three languages notwithstanding, its main target group was the newly immigrated women from Nazi Germany. The cookbook provides insights into the norms that women were supposed to follow in the allegedly private realm of housework and nutrition in pre-state Israel.

In the book, Meyer argues that the newcomers from Germany should overcome their Diaspora-identity through a new way of cooking, thereby becoming entrenched in their new homeland, Palestine. She prompts her readers to acquaint themselves with "healthy Palestine cooking." This cuisine should be based on local food staples (e.g. eggplants and zucchini) instead of European cooking traditions. Meyer also makes it clear that the homemakers were no longer responsible solely for their own family but also for the Yishuv as a whole. In the struggle for supporting the developing national economy of the Yishuv, it was the responsibility of the homemaker to "vigorously strive to buy local products" (Tozeret Haaretz).

### Ben Shemen as an emblem of a Jewish Heimat

The “youth village” Ben Shemen was designed to be a “home away from home” for Jewish teenagers who had recently immigrated to Mandate Palestine without their parents. The founders, Dr. Siegfried Lehmann, envisioned a new model of national education, which shapes individual and national identity through life and work in the rural landscape of the homeland.

At first glance, Zoltan Kluger’s photograph of Ben Shemen seems to be off the mark. Not only that the caption is wrong (the village was founded in 1927, not 1925), but the photograph also shows no sign of the features that distinguished the place from other educational institutions: e.g., the children who lived without a family in Palestine; their work in the fields; and the cultural programs that were integrated with the school curriculum. These aspects of the village were indeed underscored in various other photographs and films that documented it in the 1930s and 1940s. Yet Kluger’s image does capture the essence of Lehmann’s vision and understanding of the school. Located on the hill, surrounded by fields and a forest, the village is interwoven into the landscape while towering above it. Compared with the fields, the darker shade of the trees around the school simultaneously indicates the connection with the natural landscape and distinguishes the village from its surrounding. Simply put, in line with Lehmann’s intention, Kluger conceived Ben Shemen as an emblem of a Jewish Heimat: namely, the place that constitutes and displays the authentic bond between a people and its organic, national landscape.

### Between the Home and the Street: Jewish Dress and the Crossing of Boundaries

Items of Jewish dress are among the most interesting objects when looking at material culture, though early modern clothes are usually not preserved as objects themselves. Clothes were stored within the home when not used, though for many Jewish men and women there was not much to store. Most certainly had a separate set of clothes for Shabbat and the holidays. Clothes were worn inside and outside of the home, thus, being an object constantly crossing this boundary. Dress played a crucial role in the display of belonging, the positioning of the self within the community and vis-à-vis the other. Thus, dress closely connects Jewish homes with the life outside - within the Jewish quarter or street and on the general market place and city or village streets of early modern Europe.  
  
One of the sources commonly available to think about early modern Jewish dress are drawings and engravings (usually by non-Jewish artists) like the two displayed here. Presenting Jewish male and female dress from Nuremberg (or rather nearby Fürth as Nuremberg was closed to Jewish settlement) and Frankfurt am Main, both seem to provide a reliable depiction of early modern Jewish dress in the German lands. However, both only give a partial view. Like most drawings and engravings, they are depictions of ideal sets of dress, usually worn on Shabbat. Thus, they depict items such as the ruff or collar and the Shabbat cloak (_shulmantel_), which were not items of daily use. The Frankfurt couple included in the Neu-eröffnete Welt-Galleria of 1703 was a contemporary engraving (by Christoph Weigel), though we do not know who the model for the work was. By the late nineteenth century, Friedrich Hottenroth ventured into a three-volume project of depicting and describing German national costumes. He drew most of the depictions following older originals and descriptions. Interestingly, he mentions, that the woman’s large ruff was still common among Jews and non-Jews at the time. The red heart on the man’s costume, he states, was a specific local stigmatizing mark that Jews had to wear. However, we hardly know how he decided which clothes to depict and how to color them.

### Ruines de Capernaum \[Ruins of Capernaum\]

This historical photograph from the Lenkin Family Collection captures remnants of the ancient town of Capernaum (Kefar Naḥum in Talmudic sources, Tanḥum in Medieval sources, and the modern Arabic site name of Talḥum) prior to its excavation and transformation into a Christian pilgrimage site. The image shows the Galilean landscape of 19th century Palestine, riddled with ruins on and below the surface and inviting curiosity about the people who once lived, worked, and died there. Probing the palimpsests of the past, archaeologists excavating at Capernaum have subsequently revealed Roman/Byzantine remains including a richly decorated synagogue built from imported white limestone blocks (visible in the foreground of the image), as well as a modest Jewish fishing village with humble houses constructed from local basalt fieldstones (Tzaferis 1993).

Capernaum and other excavated settlements provide tangible windows into many aspects of “household Judaism” (Berlin 2005) and domestic life in ancient Palestine. Ancient architecture, art, and material culture reveal how Jewish homes in antiquity were spaces for creating and constraining community through access and movement, labor and maintenance practices, ritual observance, foodways, family dynamics, and gender relationships (Meyers 2008)

### Hadar ha-Karmel: a 'garden city' in Haifa

The photo of Hadar ha-Karmel neighborhood in Haifa is part of an album of 88 photos taken by the photographer Zoltan Kluger, in the years 1937-1938 in Palestine under the British Mandate. This collection contains spectacular photos of kibbutzim, moshavim, towns and cities, presenting the development of the Jewish Yishuv after a decade of tremendous waves of European Jews immigration. Kluger was the official photographer for the Zionist institutions Jewish National Fund (JNF) and Keren Hayesod, and this album is part of a large number of photos he took in Mandatory Palestine. 

Hadar ha-Karmel, or in short Hadar, was established in 1922. It was planned according to the principles of a 'garden city' by the German Jewish architect and town planner, Richard Kauffmann, who was back then the head of the planning department at the Jewish Agency. Hadar ha-Karmel was one of the first Jewish neighborhoods in Haifa, which was, and still is, a mixed city of Jews and Arabs. In the 1920s it was considered the distinct modern neighborhood of Haifa. After the 1929 Arab riots in Palestine, many Jews preferred to live in Hadar rather than in mixed neighborhoods of Jews and Arabs throughout the city. This led to the massive construction of modernist apartment buildings and the accelerated development of the neighborhood. 

The photo shows the modern apartment buildings and a big public park in the heart of Hadar ha-Karmel. The park was established in 1923 for the welfare of the neighborhood's residents. In 1925 the park was named "Gan Binyamin" after Baron Benjamin Edmond James de Rothschild, on the occasion of the Baron's visit to Haifa. The buildings and the park shown in the photo still exist today.
