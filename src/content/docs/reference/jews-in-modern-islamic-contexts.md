title: Jews in Modern Islamic Contexts
description: The study of Jewish life in modern Islamic contexts during the
  2018-19 Fellowship year at the Katz Center delved into the meaning of
  modernity in North Africa, the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, Central and
  South Asia. In their work, the Fellows broke new ground by looking beyond the
  more familiar paradigms of modern and contemporary Jewish history in European,
  American, and Israeli contexts to explore complex relationships between Jews
  and their Muslim neighbors, or with members of other non-Muslim communities in
  the Islamic world.
