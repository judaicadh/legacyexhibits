The fall of 2003 marked the 100th anniversary of the publication of the first major English-language dictionary of rabbinic literature: A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli, and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature … With an Index of Scriptural Quotations, compiled by Marcus Jastrow, a Philadelphia rabbi and a University of Pennsylvania honorary Doctor of Literature. Jastrow dedicated his dictionary to his wife Bertha Wolfsohn, with whom he had seven children, including their son Morris Jastrow, one of the founders of Religious Studies in the United States, professor of ancient Semitic languages and Penn’s University Librarian from 1898 until his death in 1921. Marcus Jastrow died in Germantown, Pennsylvania on October 13, 1903. This exhibit at Penn fittingly celebrates the anniversary of Jastrow’s dictionary and honors the centenary of its creator for his contributions to the distinguished tradition of rabbinic learning and lexicography.

## Introduction

How do we know what words mean?  What makes a definition authoritative? The modern dictionary (1) – its carefully derived etymologies (2), its hierarchically enumerated primary and secondary meanings, and its abundant literary citations of scattered historical usage – has been painstakingly compiled over the course of many centuries to respond to if not altogether answer these questions. What is known has been formatted with singular purpose and exquisite attention to detail. What is unknown or uncertain has been conscientiously omitted or else retained with a qualifying question mark. The end product of each lexical compilation, the dictionary entry, amounts to an encoded art form of presentation, concision and scholarly precision. The exact meaning of words has a book of its own: the dictionary.

This exhibit surveys a special field of dictionary-making called rabbinic lexicography (3). Rabbinic lexicography as a sub-species of dictionary-making refers to a roughly one thousand year-old corpus of literature that treats the Aramaic paraphrases of the Hebrew Bible known as Targum (4), as well as a sea of Jewish lore and legal expositions called Midrash (5) and Talmud (6).  Rabbinic lexicography in a general sense can refer to successive generations of scholars, Jews and non-Jews, who have tried to understand and interpret the lexicon of post-Biblical Jewish learning.  Their efforts have been complicated by the occurrence in rabbinic literature of a variety of unfamiliar loan words (e.g., from Greek, Latin, Persian, Arabic, and even Akkadian) and by the fact that Biblical and post-Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic writings were often copied without vowels (neḳudot) and accents (te’amim).  Consequently, even one careless breath could alter the meaning of a sacred word. Over time, inconsistencies arose between written (ḳetiv) and spoken (ḳeri) reading traditions and among various textual witnesses; the uncertain meaning of exotic words also became increasingly problematic. To redress this situation, rabbinic scholars created new tools of exegesis (7).

The effort to extricate the words of rabbis from their literary contexts, re-arrange them alphabetically as discrete terms, define their meanings historically, and refine their modes of visual presentation evolved over many centuries. From targumic paraphrases and glossed rabbinic pages to the modern rabbinic dictionary entry, rabbinic lexicography has a complex history.  It also forms a significant if often overlooked chapter in the general history of scholarship.  As Solomon Schechter, a scholar of rabbinics, once put it: “dictionaries belong to that class of literature which is mostly studied but rarely quoted.”

### Glossary

(1) Dictionary. < ad. med. L. dictiōnārium or dictiōnārius (sc. liber) lit. ‘ a repertory of dictiōnēs, phrases or words’ (see DICTION) in F. dictionnaire (R. Estienne 1539), It. dizionario, Sp. diccionario.] 1. a. a book dealing with the individual words of a language (or certain specified classes of them), so as to set forth their orthography, pronunciation, signification, and use, their synonyms, derivation, and history, or at least some of these facts: for convenience of reference, the words are arranged in some stated order, now, in most languages, alphabetical.

(2) Etymology. > a. OF. ethimologie, mod.F. etymologie, ad. L. etymologia, a. Gr. ΄ετυμολογία, f. ΄ετυμολόγος: see ETYMOLOGE ] 1. a. The process of tracing out and describing the elements of a word with their modifications of form and sense.

(3) Lexicography. >f. Gr. λεξικο-LEXICON + - γραφία-GRAPHY.] 1. a. The writing or compilation of a lexicon or dictionary; ‘the art or practice of writing dictionaries’].

(4) Targum. > a. Chaldee [Aramaic] targūm interpretation, f. targēm to interpret. Each of several Aramaic translations, interpretations, or paraphrases of the various divisions of the Old Testament, made after the Babylonian captivity, at first preserved by oral transmission, and committed to writing from about 100 A.D. onwards;

(5) Midrash. > a. post-biblical Hebrew midrāš homiletic commentary on Scripture (in biblical Hebrew ‘study, exposition’) < Hebrew dāraš to seek, study, expound. 1. a. A Rabbinic homiletic commentary on a text from the Hebrew Scriptures, characterized by non-literal interpretation and legendary illustration. Also: the mode of exegesis characteristic of such a commentary;

(6) Talmud. > a. late Heb. tal′mūd instruction (c 130 C.E.), f. lā′mad to instruct, teach. So med.L., F., Ger., etc. talmud. From its primary sense of ‘teaching, instruction, learning’, the word was applied to the teaching or instruction contained in a biblical text, and to the body of traditional learning possessed by a particular Rabbi; but it came to be applied distinctively to the discussion, explanation, and illustration of the body of traditional law contained in the Mishnah, and so to the concrete collection of this teaching. The term was originally applied to the Gemara, of which two recensions exist, known respectively as the Jerusalem (or Palestinian) and the Babylonian Talmud; to the latter of which the name is in strictest use confined.

(7) Exegesis. > a. Gr.’ εξήγησις, f. ’ εξηγέε σθαι to interpret, f. ’ εξ- (see εχ- prefix²) + ‘ ηγέε σθαιto guide, lead. Cf. F. exégèse.] 1. Explanation, exposition (of a sentence, word, etc.); esp. the interpretation of Scripture or a Scriptural passage. b. An explanatory note, a gloss].

### Life & Legacy of Marcus Jastrow
### Advent of Rabbinic Lexicography

A systematic approach to Hebrew lexicography appears to begin sometime in the 8th century C.E. These efforts were by no means unprecedented. The Hebrew Bible itself contains traditions about the origins of specific Hebrew words and names.  Early rabbinic literature—Mishnah, Tosefta, Gemarah, and Midrash—often employs etymological and grammatical interpretations of individual words as a means to achieve exegetical ends.  For the Jews, the Hebrew consonants of the Bible embodied the fundamental elements of creation whose order—the Aleph-Bet (alphabet)—was designed by God. In the 7th century, a corpus devoted to the textual stabilization and authoritative transmission of the divine letters of the Hebrew Bible, the Masorah (from the Hebrew מסר, masar “to transmit, hand down”), began to appear.  The Masoretes (the scholars who tried to determine the written text of the Hebrew Bible) intensively studied the formation and frequency of occurrence of the words of their received sacred writings.  Jewish masoretic activity grew during the same period that Islamic scholars of Arabic and Christian scholars of Syriac (Christian Aramaic) began to investigate and classify their own respective languages. From the 7th-9th centuries, thus, the idea of the dictionary emerges as a systematic classification of the biblical lexicon into an organized inventory for consultation.

During the time of the masoretes, two sects of Judaism were consolidating.  Rabbanite Jews followed the text of the Bible (Torah she-bi-khtav, the written tradition) and recognized the authority of orally transmitted traditions of interpretation (Torah she-be-‘al peh) by rabbis whose teachings were eventually collected and written down in two different recensions of what was called Talmud.  About 760 C.E., the heads of the Jewish Academies in Babylonia elected Hananiah ben David exilarch, the head of Babylonian diasporic Jewry.  Hananiah, however, was second in the line of succession.  His older brother Anan ben David, first in line, rebelled against the academies and the proponents of the Talmud, and delclared himself anti-exilarch. Anan rejected the legitimacy of the rabbanite traditions of interpretation and instead claimed the Bible, not the rabbis and their schools, as the authoritative voice of tradition. Anan’s followers were known as Karaites (from the Hebrew קרא  ḳara —“ to call out or read,” i.e., the Bible).  Both Karaites and Rabbanites believed in the sacred authority of the Hebrew Bible and both sects perpetuated the masoretic tradition.  Rabbanites, however, possessed an additional, and immense, literary corpus repudiated by the Karaites. The Geonim (the heads of the rabbanite academies of Babylonia) Sa‘adiah ben Joseph al-Fayyumi (882-942), and Ḥai ben Sherira (939–1038) composed the first rabbinic lexicons in the 9th and 10th centuries. Much of the evidence for this period’s activity, some of which is on display here, is known today from the recovery of medieval texts stored—disposed of—in the attic of one synagogue in Fustat, the old city of Cairo. This remarkable storehold (genizah) of fragmentary documents is known as the Cairo Genizah.

#### Section 1

fig. 1: This Genizah fragment is from a commentary on a piyyut, or liturgical poem, in which thirteen difficult and rare words are used.  The commentator provides definitions in Arabic (the vernacular of Jews living under medieval Islam) and compares their meanings with Hebrew biblical citations.

fig. 2: This fragment is part of a bilingual glossary of the Bible, similar to the Kitāb Jāmi al-Alfās (“Book of a collection of words”) compiled by the Moroccan Karaite David ben Abraham al-Fasi (“one from the city of Fez”) in the second half of the 10th century. Alfasi draws on both Karaite and Rabbanite authors. While he directly cites the Karaites by their proper names, al-Fasi refers only indirectly to rabbinic sources, citing the rabbis not by name, but by their places of origin.

fig. 3: The Jewish translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, or Targum, served dual purposes: they provided a relatively equivalent paraphrase of the text in the contemporary Jewish (non-Hebrew) vernacular, and they simultaneously explained and elucidated the meaning of the text to the common reader. Targum functioned, in brief, as much as a commentary as a translation.  The Arabic tafsir had the same tasks. Its root (فسر F-S-R) IS the same as that of the Hebrew Pesher (פשר P-Š-R), which in the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls refers to a short running commentary that also serves as an explanation. The tafsir in this fragment contains definitions of words and terms that rarely occur in the Mishnah, and therefore can only represent an early form of rabbinic lexicographic interpretation.

fig. 4: Sa‘adiah (Fayum, Egypt 882-Sura, Persia 942), served as Gaon (“leader”) of the rabbinic academy of Sura from 928 until his death, and was the first Jew called upon from outside Babylonia/Persia to serve in that capacity. One of the great rabbinic authorities of all time, whose vast knowledge encompassed Greek and Arabic scholarship, he was also one of the earliest rabbinic lexicographers—certainly the earliest whose works have survived to the present day (an earlier Gaon, Tsemah ben Paltoi [872-890] is also known to have prepared a dictionary, but nothing of the work has survived). Sa‘adiah was active in the dual role of translator and commentator. His dictionary, the ’Egron, literally “collection [of words]”, is his earliest known work, composed when the author was twenty. It contains Biblical Hebrew terms as well as obscure and difficult words found in rabbinic literature. The work is arranged in alphabetical order according to root (i.e., the base stem of the word), which Sa‘adiah believed could consist of one to five consonants.

fig. 5: Sa‘adiah’s works traveled far and quickly.  Within his own lifetime his Egron reached the eastern shores of Al-Andalus—Islamic Spain. Ḥasdai ibn Shaprut (915-ca. 990), one of the most influential and powerful Jewish figures of his generation, was then serving as a high official to the court of Andalusian Cordova. Among his circle was Menaḥem ibn Saruq (ca. Tolosa 910-Cordova ca. 970).  Ibn Saruq’s lexicon, entitled Maḥberet (“notebook”), was modeled after Sa‘adiah’s Egron, classifying words according to their consonantal root.  However, unlike the Egron, the Maḥberet concentrates only on biblical Hebrew and Aramaic (“Chaldaic”), albeit according to rabbinic interpretation. On display is the first printed edition of Menaḥem’s lexicon. Prior to its publication the Maḥberet was known only through citations by medieval commentators such as Rashi.

#### Section 2
fig. 1: Although Menaḥem occasionally questioned Sa‘adiah’s Egron, he did not contest Sa‘adiah’s authority or method of grammatical analysis.  Menaḥem closely adhered to the theory delineated by Sa‘adia in his grammar—the Fasih lughah al-'Ibraniyin (“Treatise on the language of the Hebrews”, written in Arabic) that Hebrew words may be based on roots consisting of 1 to 5 consonants.  A bitter challenge to the theory held by Menaḥem and Sa‘adiah came from one of Menaḥem’s own successors, Dunash ben Labrat. Dunash, originally from Fez but residing in Cordova, in accord with the theories of Arabic grammarians, maintained that Hebrew words must be derived from three radical consonants i. e., root system.  The Genizah fragment on display is from a proponent of the school of Dunash.

fig. 2: Both of these works, again seen in their first printed editions, took Dunash’s three consonant root theory into account against the realities of Hebrew words, that many did appear to be based on one to five roots, as Sa‘adiah had first claimed. Judah ben David Ḥayyuj (ca. 945-ca. 1000) reconciled this with the theory that the Hebrew roots were classified as either strong, that is, consisting clearly of three consonants, or weak, in which at least one consonant appears to be missing.  Ibn Janah (ca. 990-ca. 1050 = “Rabbi Yonah”) elaborated this theory into the form of the the first Hebrew dictionary to be known as “the book of roots”.  Notably, this first edition of Ḥayyuj’s treatise was edited by Jastrow.
